# ChatGPT Plugin - Python FastAPI, Vercel Boilerplate

This repository contains a boilerplate for creating a [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction) Plugin API using FastAPI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you know how to work with the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation)
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)

## Developing Locally

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnVersus/chatgpt-plugin-python-vercel-boilerplate.git your_project_name

cd your_project_name
```

2. Create an venv and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:8000` to see your API in action.

## Files required to be updated to make your own plugin

1. `api/app.py` holds the APP API routes. Modify them to build your own application.

2. Once you have build the API of your plugin start the localhost server with `python3 main.py` command.

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` to view the openAPI json generated by FastAPI.

4. You can using this json to generate yaml code. You can use any only line generators or use ChatGPT for the convertions.

5. Paste the generated yaml in `static/openapi.yaml` file.

6. Finally update the `static/ai-plugin.json` and other files present under the `static` folder to your need.

## Testing the Plugin API Locally

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to access the interactive Swagger UI documentation. Here you can explore the available endpoints and test them out.

## Deploying with Vercel

This boilerplate is designed to be deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Please follow Vercel's [deployment documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments) for details.

## Installing the Plugin on ChatGPT

1. Deploy the API using Vercel or a platform of your choice.
2. Go to ChatGPT and select the `Develop your own plugin` option.
3. Enter the deployed URL of your API. For example: `https://chatgpt-plugin-python-vercel-boilerplate.vercel.app/` is the url for the Bookstore template plugin.

Once installed, you can start using the API endpoints from ChatGPT.
